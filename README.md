# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

## Overview
This is a simple **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game implemented in Python. The user plays against the computer, which randomly selects a move. The game follows standard rules and runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit.

## How It Works
1. The user selects their move: **Rock, Paper, or Scissors**.
2. The computer randomly selects its move.
3. The winner is determined based on the following rules:
   - **Rock vs Rock â†’ Tie**
   - **Rock vs Paper â†’ Paper Wins**
   - **Rock vs Scissors â†’ Rock Wins**
   - **Paper vs Paper â†’ Tie**
   - **Paper vs Rock â†’ Paper Wins**
   - **Paper vs Scissors â†’ Scissors Wins**
   - **Scissors vs Scissors â†’ Tie**
   - **Scissors vs Rock â†’ Rock Wins**
   - **Scissors vs Paper â†’ Scissors Wins**
4. The game continues until the user enters **'Exit'**.
